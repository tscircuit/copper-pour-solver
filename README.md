# @tscircuit/copper-pour-solver

Solves PCB copper pour regions from Circuit JSON or from a small geometry input
format, returning `pcb_copper_pour`-ready B-Rep shapes.

## Install

```bash
bun add @tscircuit/copper-pour-solver
```

This package expects TypeScript 5 as a peer dependency.

## Basic Usage With Circuit JSON

Initialize the geometry runtime once before solving. Then convert Circuit JSON
into the solver input format, run the solver, and map the returned B-Rep shapes
back into `pcb_copper_pour` elements.

```ts
import {
  CopperPourPipelineSolver,
  convertCircuitJsonToInputProblem,
  initializeManifoldGeometry,
} from "@tscircuit/copper-pour-solver"

await initializeManifoldGeometry()

const inputProblem = convertCircuitJsonToInputProblem(circuitJson, {
  layer: "top",
  source_net_name: "GND",
  pad_margin: 0.4,
  trace_margin: 0.2,
  board_edge_margin: 0.1,
  cutout_margin: 0.2,
  use_thermal_reliefs: true,
  thermal_relief_spoke_width: 0.3,
  thermal_relief_spoke_count: 4,
})

const solver = new CopperPourPipelineSolver(inputProblem)
const { brep_shapes } = solver.getOutput()
```

`convertCircuitJsonToInputProblem` reads board bounds or outline, SMT pads,
plated holes, mechanical holes, vias, traces, and cutouts for the selected layer.
Pads and traces connected to the selected source net are kept connected to the
pour; unrelated geometry is subtracted using the configured margins.
When `use_thermal_reliefs` is true, plated holes and SMT pads on the pour net are
isolated by the `pad_margin` air gap and reconnected by evenly spaced spokes.
`thermal_relief_spoke_width` is required and `thermal_relief_spoke_count`
defaults to 4. Same-net vias and traces remain solid-connected.

Pass an options array to solve all pours from one subcircuit together. This is
required for pour-to-pour clearance because the solver must see every region in
the same input problem. Array order is the priority order: later pours take
priority over earlier pours.

## Selecting The Pour Net

Prefer selecting by source net name or id:

```ts
const inputProblem = convertCircuitJsonToInputProblem(circuitJson, {
  layer: "top",
  source_net_name: "GND",
  pad_margin: 0.4,
  trace_margin: 0.2,
})
```

You can also pass the source net's stable `subcircuit_connectivity_map_key`
directly:

```ts
const gnd = circuitJson.find(
  (element) => element.type === "source_net" && element.name === "GND",
)

const inputProblem = convertCircuitJsonToInputProblem(circuitJson, {
  layer: "top",
  subcircuit_id: gnd.subcircuit_id,
  subcircuit_connectivity_map_key: gnd.subcircuit_connectivity_map_key,
  pad_margin: 0.4,
  trace_margin: 0.2,
})
```

Pass `subcircuit_id` when selecting a net inside a subcircuit. The converter
considers that subcircuit and its child subcircuits, but it does not treat
matching child `subcircuit_connectivity_map_key` values as connected unless the
Circuit JSON connectivity actually connects them. Internally, the generated
`globalConnectivityMap` is kept separate from the scoped
`subcircuitConnectivityMap`; scoped solver connectivity keys are prefixed with
their subcircuit id.

Do not generate or pass ids from `circuit-json-to-connectivity-map`. The
converter handles PCB connectivity internally and normalizes it to stable
`subcircuit_connectivity_map_key` values.

## Manual Input

You can skip Circuit JSON conversion and provide the solver input directly.

```ts
import {
  CopperPourPipelineSolver,
  initializeManifoldGeometry,
  type InputProblem,
} from "@tscircuit/copper-pour-solver"

await initializeManifoldGeometry()

const input: InputProblem = {
  regionsForPour: [
    {
      shape: "rect",
      layer: "top",
      bounds: { minX: -10, minY: -5, maxX: 10, maxY: 5 },
      connectivityKey: "net:GND",
      padMargin: 0.4,
      traceMargin: 0.2,
      pourMargin: 0.2,
      board_edge_margin: 0.1,
      use_thermal_reliefs: true,
      thermal_relief_spoke_width: 0.3,
      thermal_relief_spoke_count: 4,
    },
  ],
  pads: [
    {
      shape: "circle",
      padId: "via_1",
      layer: "top",
      connectivityKey: "net:VCC",
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      radius: 0.5,
      isPlatedHole: true,
    },
  ],
}

const output = new CopperPourPipelineSolver(input).getOutput()
```

Supported input pad shapes are `rect`, `circle`, `pill`, `trace`, and `polygon`.
Use the same `connectivityKey` as the pour for pads/traces that should connect to
the copper island; use a different key for blockers that should be cleared.
When multiple regions share a layer, later entries have higher priority. A
lower-priority region is cleared from higher-priority, different-net copper by
the larger of the two regions' `pourMargin` values. Same-net regions and regions
on different layers do not block each other.

Set `removeDisconnectedIslands` on generated pour regions to remove exact
post-clearance islands that cannot reach a same-net pad or trace. Adjacent
same-net regions are checked together, so polygon partition boundaries do not
break valid connections. The Circuit JSON adapter exposes this as
`remove_disconnected_islands`.

## Output

`getOutput()` returns:

```ts
interface PipelineOutput {
  brep_shapes: BRepShape[]
  brep_shapes_by_region: BRepShape[][]
}
```

`brep_shapes` is the flattened result in input-region order.
`brep_shapes_by_region` preserves the association between each input region and
its generated shapes.

Each B-Rep shape is compatible with Circuit JSON copper pour data:

```ts
interface BRepShape {
  outer_ring: {
    vertices: Array<{ x: number; y: number; bulge?: number }>
  }
  inner_rings: Array<{
    vertices: Array<{ x: number; y: number; bulge?: number }>
  }>
}
```
